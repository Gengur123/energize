    <h2><strong>February 2023 update: Southside pilot price adjustment</strong></h2>
    <div>On<strong> Monday, March 6, 2023</strong>, the City will increase the price of hourly parking in the Southside visitor paid parking pilot from $2.00/hour to $2.50/hour. Staff collected parking occupancy data earlier this month and found that parking in the SmartSpace area is well used. Unfortunately, it remains difficult to find a parking space when demand is the highest. At 1pm on a weekday, most blocks are more than 85% occupied &ndash; effectively full.</div>
    <div></div>
    <div>Berkeley uses demand-responsive pricing to manage on-street paid parking citywide, including in the SmartSpace pilot area. Our goal is to set the lowest price at which most blocks will have an occupancy rate between 65% and 85%, which is roughly equivalent to at least 1-2 open spaces. When adequate parking is available, drivers do not have to circle for a spot, even at peak times. If parking occupancies in an area are less than the target rate, prices are lowered to encourage more people to park there. If occupancies exceed the target, prices are increased to discourage parking where it is already full. Under goBerkeley program guidelines, prices can be adjusted by no more than $0.25 or $0.50. Staff will monitor the effects of this price adjustment later this spring and may recommend another adjustment if the target rate remains unmet.</div>

<p>Thank you for your continued interest and/or participation in the goBerkeley SmartSpace pilot program over the past few years. Based on feedback from the community, the City tested<strong> paid parking for visitors in the Southside</strong> pilot area and<strong> parking permits for Elmwood employees</strong> as ways to reduce the &ldquo;two-hour shuffle&rdquo; in residential neighborhoods south of the UC Berkeley campus. Over the past several months, staff collected and analyzed data to evaluate the effects of these strategies in light of key project goals. Below is a brief summary of our findings:</p>
<div><strong>Goal: Reduce occurrences of, and greenhouse gas emissions from, the &ldquo;two-hour shuffle&rdquo; </strong></div>
<div><span>&bull; The number of vehicles observed doing the &ldquo;two-hour shuffle&rdquo; dropped by nearly one-half (from 61 to 33) in the Elmwood and by one-third (from 43 to 29) in the Southside on an average weekday before and after the pilot was implemented. CO2 emissions from shuffling dropped by approximately one-third in each area. These reductions may in part reflect employees who were assigned parking permits in the Elmwood, and/or regular visitors to the Southside paying to park for up to eight hours in the pilot zone. </span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>(CO2 emissions were calculated by measuring the distance in miles between each consecutive observed location of shuffling vehicles, and multiplying by relevant California Air Resources Board emissions factors.)</span></div>
<div><br /><span></span></div>

<div><strong>Goal: Increase parking availability in residential areas </strong></div>
<div><span>&bull; Parking remained consistently full in the Southside visitor paid parking area, even after the hourly price was introduced in October and increased in March. Further price adjustments may be needed to improve availability in this area. </span></div>
<br />
<div><span>&bull; Parking availability increased in the Elmwood pilot area between 2021 and 2023 at the weekday peak hour, though it is not clear to what extent the new parking permits may have played a role.</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<br />
<div><span>Based on these findings, staff are recommending that the City Council <strong>approve the continuation of both strategies tested under the pilot</strong> at the June 27, 2023 Council Meeting. More information about the implementation of the pilot and the evaluation will be available in the June 27 Council Report, which will be available on the City&rsquo;s website</span></div>
